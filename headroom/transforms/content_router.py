"""Content router for intelligent compression strategy selection.

This module provides the ContentRouter, which analyzes content and routes it
to the optimal compressor. It handles mixed content by splitting, routing
each section to the appropriate compressor, and reassembling.

Supported Compressors:
- CodeAwareCompressor: Source code (AST-preserving)
- SmartCrusher: JSON arrays
- SearchCompressor: grep/ripgrep results
- LogCompressor: Build/test output
- KompressCompressor: Plain text (ML-based)
- Kompress: Plain text (ML-based, requires [ml] extra)

Routing Strategy:
1. Use source hint if available (highest confidence)
2. Check for mixed content (split and route sections)
3. Detect content type (JSON, code, search, logs, text)
4. Route to appropriate compressor
5. Reassemble and return with routing metadata

Usage:
    >>> from headroom.transforms import ContentRouter
    >>> router = ContentRouter()
    >>> result = router.compress(content)  # Auto-routes to best compressor
    >>> print(result.strategy_used)
    >>> print(result.routing_log)

Pipeline Usage:
    >>> pipeline = TransformPipeline([
    ...     ContentRouter(),   # Handles all content types
    ... ])

    Such reads must NOT be lossy-compressed: the agent needs the exact bytes to produce
    a precise patch. Lossy-compressing them was observed (SWE-bench, mini-swe-agent) to
    cause the agent to RE-READ the same file (cat -> cat -A -> cat -n) to recover exact
    detail — turn inflation — and, when recovery failed, resolve loss. Search/list/test
    output (grep/rg/ls/find/pytest) is derived and stays compressible.

    This identifies that a command is a file READ. Whether the read is actually PROTECTED
    is finalized downstream by CONTENT type (see ``_read_output_should_be_protected``):
    reads are protected by default, and only released to compression when the output is a
    confidently non-code DATA type. The one command-level carve-out is lockfiles: they
    detect as PLAIN_TEXT (so the content gate would protect them) yet are regenerated
    artifacts, never byte-patched — so a lockfile read returns False here and stays
    compressible.

    Excludes writes: a redirect (``>``/``>>``), ``tee``, or heredoc (``<<``) means the

    ``str(block)`` for anything that was not ``text`` or ``tool_result``, on the

    """Intelligent router that selects optimal compression strategy.

    ContentRouter is the recommended entry point for Headroom's compression.
    It analyzes content and routes it to the most appropriate compressor,
    handling mixed content by splitting and reassembling.

    Key Features:
    - Automatic content type detection
    - Source hint support for high-confidence routing
    - Mixed content handling (split → route → reassemble)
    - Graceful fallback when compressors unavailable
    - Rich routing metadata for debugging

    Example:
        >>> router = ContentRouter()
        >>>
        >>> # Automatically uses CodeAwareCompressor
        >>> result = router.compress(python_code)
        >>> print(result.strategy_used)  # CompressionStrategy.CODE_AWARE
        >>>
        >>> # Automatically uses SmartCrusher
        >>> result = router.compress(json_array)
        >>> print(result.strategy_used)  # CompressionStrategy.SMART_CRUSHER
        >>>
        >>> # Splits and routes each section
        >>> result = router.compress(readme_with_code)

        form is already computed when this runs), S is the token total after
        the slot, and R / P_alive are env-tunable constants
        (``HEADROOM_NET_COST_EXPECTED_READS``, default 10;
        ``HEADROOM_NET_COST_P_ALIVE``, default 1.0 — the conservative
        full-penalty assumption). Every decision is logged with its inputs
        and counted in ``route_counts`` so the flag can be validated from
        telemetry before any default-on.

        #856 P3a (batch deep edits): a mutation at depth K busts the
        provider's cached suffix after K, so every *later* candidate at a
        deeper slot rides that same invalidation for free — mutating it adds
        no incremental cache-bust cost. ``batch_state["floor"]`` tracks the
        shallowest slot already admitted as a net-positive mutation. When the
        current candidate sits strictly deeper than that floor, S is charged
        as 0 (rather than the full invalidated suffix), so the break-even
        formula admits it on the write/read economics alone. Charging S=0 via
        the same ``net_mutation_gain`` (instead of blanket-admitting on
        ``delta_t > 0``) keeps the decision conservative: it never admits a
        mutation the real economics would reject. The floor is only set/lowered
        by full-S admits, so a slot only ever rides free behind a genuinely
        mutated shallower slot. Each batch admission emits the
        ``router:netcost_batch_admit`` marker and the ``netcost_batch_admitted``
        counter for telemetry.

        #856 P3b (idle-timer compaction): ``p_alive_override``, when supplied
        by the caller, replaces the static ``HEADROOM_NET_COST_P_ALIVE``
        constant. It is derived in ``apply`` from how long the session has
        been idle relative to the provider cache TTL
        (``max(0, 1 − idle_s / ttl)``). As the cached suffix nears lapse
        P_alive → 0, the ``P_alive·(w−r)·(S+ΔT)`` penalty vanishes, and edits
        that would lose to a warm suffix become free — the suffix is about to
        be rebuilt cold regardless. ``None`` preserves the P2 env-constant
        behaviour. An admit made under a decayed (``< 1.0``) idle P_alive emits
        the ``router:netcost_idle_compaction`` marker and the

             compression is byte-deterministic.
          3. User and system blocks carry the prompt the model is acting
             on; compressing them silently mutates the request. Always
             skipped per `skip_user` / `skip_system`.
          4. Tool / function blocks are tool outputs — semantically safe
             to compress (the model references them once, then moves on).

            message: The original message.
            content_blocks: List of content blocks.
            context: Context for compression.
            transforms_applied: List to append transform names to.
            excluded_tool_ids: Tool IDs to skip compression for.
            ccr_retrieve_tool_ids: Tool IDs whose output is a headroom_retrieve result --
                always passed through verbatim (see module-level comment at the
                precompute site for why this can never fall through to compression).
            tool_name_map: Mapping from tool_call_id to tool_name for profile lookup.
            route_counts: Optional routing reason counters to update.
            compressed_details: Optional list to append compression details to.
            min_ratio: Adaptive compression ratio threshold.
            read_protection_window: Messages from end within which excluded tools are protected.
            messages_from_end: How far this message is from the end of the conversation.
            min_chars: Minimum block content length (chars) to consider for compression.
            skip_user: If True, never compress text blocks in user-role messages.
            skip_system: If True, never compress text blocks in system-role messages.
            compress_assistant_text_blocks: If True, allow compressing text blocks in
                assistant-role messages. Default False (cache-safe).

        Returns:
            Transformed message with compressed content blocks.
