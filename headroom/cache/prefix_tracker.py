"""Prefix Cache Tracker — session-scoped state for cache-aware compression.

Tracks provider prefix cache state between turns so the transform pipeline
can freeze already-cached messages and only compress new content.

Problem: Clients like Claude Code already manage prefix caching (up to 4
cache_control breakpoints, growing-prefix strategy). If Headroom compresses
or modifies messages in the cached prefix, it invalidates the cache —
replacing a 90% read discount (Anthropic) or 50% (OpenAI) with a 25%
write penalty.

Solution: After each API response, record how many tokens the provider
cached. On the next turn, freeze that many messages so the transform
pipeline skips them entirely.

    Two forces pile up cache_control markers turn over turn: clients move the
    breakpoint to the newest message each call, and ``overlay_cached_prefix``
    replays the markers that rode on each turn's then-newest message. Anthropic
    hard-errors at **>4 cache_control blocks total** (system + tools + messages),
    so on a long conversation the accumulation eventually 400s.

    Fix: strip EVERY message-level cache_control and re-place a **single**
    ephemeral breakpoint. Pure append-only growth keeps it on the newest block,
    which both reads the prior write and writes the appended tail. If last turn's
    counterpart proves that the tail was rewritten, it is placed at the end of
    the byte-stable leading run instead. One breakpoint caches the prefix up to
    it, and — because the provider's cache key is message CONTENT, not marker
    presence (moving the
    breakpoint forward is the documented client pattern and it hits) — stripping
    and re-placing markers never busts. system/tools breakpoints live outside
    ``messages`` and are left untouched (they still count toward the 4 limit, so
    holding messages to one breakpoint leaves room for them).

    Headroom owns WHERE the breakpoint goes; the client still owns WHAT it says:
    the re-placed marker reuses the newest client marker verbatim, so an explicit
    ``ttl`` (e.g. ``"1h"``) survives consolidation instead of silently
    downgrading to the 5-minute default (#2375).

        #856 P3b feeds this to the net-cost gate as an idle signal: as it
        approaches the provider's prompt-cache TTL (~300s for Anthropic),
        P_alive decays toward 0 and deep edits near cache lapse become free.
        Distinct from :attr:`is_expired`, which uses the much longer
        session-tracker *cleanup* TTL (``session_ttl_seconds``), not the cache
        TTL.

        Wiring caveat: ``SessionTrackerStore.get_or_create`` refreshes
        ``_last_activity`` on access, so a caller that wants the idle gap
        since the *previous turn's response* must read this before fetching
        the tracker for the current request (or the store must capture it at
        fetch time). ``update_from_response`` is the per-turn activity stamp.

        Concurrent conversations often share a fallback session id — same

        parallel subagents, or several sessions in one workspace. On a shared
        tracker their interleaved histories cross-contaminate the
        frozen-prefix state: freeze never stabilizes and the provider prompt
        cache is re-written on nearly every call.

        Lineage resolution keys trackers by conversation content instead:
        reuse the tracker whose previous request messages are a prefix of the
        incoming history. It also recognizes a conservative block-level shape
        where a large leading run and two-block identity suffix survive while
        the middle tail is regenerated; all other rewrites start a fresh
        lineage. This keeps #2671's stable cache boundary attached without
        merging unrelated parallel sub-calls.
        Byte-identical histories (templated fan-outs before they diverge)
        intentionally share a tracker: their provider cache line is identical
        too, so sharing is harmless.

        The session id itself is never altered, so session-sticky state keyed
        on it elsewhere (beta headers, CCR/memory registries, the compression
        cache) is unaffected.
