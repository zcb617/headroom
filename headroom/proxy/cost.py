    server instances to the cross-process shared events file.

    The Headroom MCP server (``headroom mcp serve``) records every
    ``headroom_compress`` and ``headroom_retrieve`` invocation to a
    file-locked shared log (see :func:`headroom.ccr.mcp_server._append_shared_event`).
    This helper reads that log and aggregates within the rolling window
    so the proxy's ``/stats`` can surface MCP-side work alongside the
    proxy's own HTTP-path compression numbers.

    Returns zeros for every key if the MCP SDK isn't installed, the
    shared file doesn't exist yet, or any read error occurs — the
    intent is "if there's nothing to report, report zero" so this
    helper never blocks the summary.

    Keys: ``compressions`` (count of headroom_compress calls),
    ``tokens_removed`` (sum of input_tokens-output_tokens across
    compress events), ``retrievals`` (count of headroom_retrieve
    calls — the load-bearing over-compression signal).
